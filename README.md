FRC Robotics Simulator Game

Thanks to 
@webcyou
@panicdragon
for the initial starter code!

This simulator is meant to mimic an FRC match from a top-down perspective. It uses Flutter with Flame and Forge2d. 
Currently, RiverPod is being actively implemented to allow for easier future development.

The simulator has realistic physics on acceleration, inertia, and collisions. 
I hope you enjoy it!
